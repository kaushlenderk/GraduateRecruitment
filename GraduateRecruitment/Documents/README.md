## GraduateRecruitment
Master Software Engineering course project

## Description:

The aim of the project is to develop an online Graduate Recruitment (GradRec) web portal for the university. The online website will 
allow the departments to advertise upcoming graduation recruitment (Masters/PhD) programs with research details for the prospective 
students.
The system will allow students to submit their profiles with the information such as education background, previous research 
experience and interests, and other relevant details. They will be able to select a program based on their research interests from an 
available list, and provide their motives and justifications for selecting that specific program.

The system is also going to be responsible for handling all future communications between the project management team and the students, 
and handling functionalities such as offering the formal accept or decline letter to the students and monitoring the progress of the 
student throughout the life of his/her program.
